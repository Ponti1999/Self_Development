# 9. Palindrome Number


[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number)

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise. <br/>

## Example 1:

Input: x = 121 <br/>
Output: true <br/>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left. <br/>

## Example 2:

Input: x = -121 <br/>
Output: false <br/>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome. <br/>

## Example 3:

Input: x = 10 <br/>
Output: false <br/>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome. <br/>

## Constraints:
- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1 <br/>

Follow-up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?


## Problem solving approach:
- First I am trying to solve the problem with the most basic solution.
- If it is a palindrome, the beginning and the end of the number should be the same.
- With the follow-up we should revers the integer and compare it with the original one.

## Optimizations:
- Solution 1:
  - Brute force solution.

- Solution 2:
  - Follow up challenge solution.

- Solution 3:
  - Using python's string slicing. (Syntax: [start:stop:step])

- Cover the edge cases:
  - Negative numbers are not palindromes.
  - 0 is a palindrome (Optional).
  - Or the length of the str(number) is 1 (Optional).


## Solution 1:
```Python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False
        str_x = str(x)
        for i in range(len(str_x)):
            if str_x[i] != str_x[len(str_x)-i-1]:
                return False
        return True
```

## Solution 2:

```Python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False
        x_copy = x
        reversed_num = 0
        while x_copy != 0:
            digit = x_copy % 10
            reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit
            x_copy //= 10
        if x == reversed_num:
            return True
        return False
```

## Solution 3:

```Python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False
        elif x==0:
            return True
        return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
```
